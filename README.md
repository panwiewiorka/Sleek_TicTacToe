# Sleek TicTacToe

Yet another TicTacToe (aka N in a row) game, but with:
- Straight to the point interface and lightweight look
- Autosave of all settings, including current game progress
- Basic AI to play against (additionally to 2 players mode)
- TalkBack features
- Adaptive layout:
  * Maximum board size depends on device size (bigger boards on tablets)
  * Portrait and landscape interface orientation
  * Proper handling of squarish screen ratio
- Different modes (N in a row wins / loses)
- Light / Dark theme
- Easter egg (changing X O symbols to others)
